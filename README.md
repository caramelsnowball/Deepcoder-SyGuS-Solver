# Deepcoder-SyGuS-Solver

An enumerative solution to the [Syntax Guided Synthesis](http://www.sygus.org/) problem. This solution also contains a prototype for how machine learning could be used to map attributes of the input constraints to likely attributes of a solution to those constraints (such as the probable depth of the solution function tree, the likelihood of the solution function containing an addition expression, etc.). These attributes could then be used to guide enumeration in order to improve the performance of the algorithm.
